				 <h2>My memories of the work of installing the wedding couch</h2>
				 <p>After SPM, I applied for a job at a bridal boutique. I worked full time for 6 months. The scope of work at the boutique is sewing beads on wedding dresses, making wedding favors, serving customers who are brides-to-be who need our services and others. Also that, I need follow them to install the couch. This work is very fun even though it is tiring. After getting a call from UPU, I continued my diploma. At the same time I worked part-time at the boutique.</p>
				 <br>
				 <p>I gained a lot of experience while working there. One of them is how to serve customers, how to wash the wedding dress (very tiring because it's difficult), how to prepare the bride, how to make a delivery composition, how to make up, and most importantly how to set up a dais, set up a civilized table, prepare a flowery gate and everything related marriage.</p>
				 <br>
				 <p>All in all, it was a lot of fun. I miss that job</p>

				 <h2>My memories joining Commerce Club</h2>
				 <p>After SPM,I applied UPU. I got an offer for continue my studies at Diploma level. I got Diploma of Accountancy.</p>
				 <br>
				 <p>which I was not interested in at first. But during the 2nd semester, I started to get busy by joining some organizations at the polytechnic. One of them is the Commerce Club. This club is under the auspices of the Department of Commerce. Commerce Club taught me a lot about the meaning of responsibility to carry out tasks with honesty, trust, and efficient time management. This club has a lot of good things even though there are bittersweet memories while serving in this club. I participate in many programs organized by this club. Most of them cooperate a lot with the student representative council, other departments, other polytechnics and external parties.</p>
				 <br>
				 <p>All in all, it was a lot of fun. I miss them, I miss my lecturers, my friends, all about my polytechnic.</p>

				 <h2>My memories while doing practical work at the Kulim Bandar Baharu District Education Office </h2>
				 <p>Before i complete my Diploma Certificate, I need to do practical in last sem for completed my Diploma.</p>
				 <br>
				 <p>I learned a lot while doing practicals here. I was placed in the finance department. A lot of knowledge about schools that I didn't know or didn't care about before. The officers here gave a lot of advice and knowledge to me and my friends. It is the most precious memory in my life. I will remember it forever.</p>
				 <br>
				 <p>I miss the gang of teachers, officers, all the good staff and the friends I just got to know when I was there. May we meet again :)</p>
